# TritonEngine
A game engine designed to use for long distance space flight simulations with extensive rendering capabilities with far larger worlds than standard game engines.

## Triton Project - Description
Based on the concepts introduced in the XNA Neptune engine, this is a game engine developed specifically to model game mechanics in accurate and natural physics systems. It will also be used to simulate extra terrestrial colonization and space warfare. Using modern physics theories, this engine is designed to support a few theoretical concepts in space travel and warfare. Ranging from propulsion systems such as ion drives, fusion drives, solar sails, and the Alcubiere warp drive. The warfare aspects will include but not limited to energy based weapons such as lasers, plasma projectiles, guided heat seaking missiles, electronic warfare, nuclear weapons, and even biological warfare.

## Simulation Features
- N-Body physics simulation
- Newtonian physics in combination with general relativity
- Arbitrary grvity, centrifugal, anti-mass, and exotic matter
- Space-Time warps e.g. the Alcubiere drive
- electromagnetic radiation physics
- Quantum mechanics, allowing for violation of relativity
- Mass/energy conversions e.g. rocket fuel burn decreases mass
- light speed i.e. can dialate time
- FTL -  consequently allow of time travel

## Engine Features
- Allow for building O'Niel cylinders with accurate human level physics
- Atmospheric and realtime light scattering
- Massive true-to-scale planets and extra-terrestrial objects
- Volumetric gas giants
- Dyanmic terrain subdivision, and possible voxel systems
- Totally impractical simulation for anything except real space
- Save states will allow user to exist in different points in space/time
- AI behaviors that mimic the advancement of technology through time
- Dynamic-Self AI, allows the game to model AI based on you, the player, to allow one to encounter themself in the past
