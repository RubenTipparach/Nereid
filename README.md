# TritonEngine
A game engine designed to use for long distance space flight simulations with extensive rendering capabilities with far larger worlds than standard game engines.

## Description
This is a game engine developed specifically to model game mechanics in accurate and natural physics systems.

## Simulation Features
- N-Body physics simulation
- Newtonian physics in combination with general relativity
- Arbitrary grvity, centrifugal, anti-mass, and exotic matter
- Space-Time warps e.g. the Alcubiere drive
- electromagnetic radiation physics
- Quantum mechanics, allowing for violation of relativity
- Mass/energy conversions e.g. rocket fuel burn decreases mass
- light speed i.e. can dialate time
- FTL -  consequently allow of time travel

## Engine Features
- Allow for building O'Niel cylinders with accurate human level physics
- Atmospheric and realtime light scattering
- Massive true-to-scale planets and extra-terrestrial objects
- Volumetric gas giants
- Dyanmic terrain subdivision, and possible voxel systems
- Totally impractical simulation for anything except real space
- Save states will allow user to exist in different points in space/time
- AI behaviors that mimic the advancement of technology through time
- Dynamic-Self AI, allows the game to model AI based on you, the player, to allow one to encounter themself in the past
